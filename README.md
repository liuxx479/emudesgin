Optimal Emulator Parameter Sampling Strategy for Cosmological Simulations

Nesar Ramachandra, Jia Liu

Questions to answer:
1. the optimal sampling strategy for various cosmological observable (Pk, Clkk, HMF, Primary CMB)?
2. the number of sample points needed as a function of number of parameters, say to reach <1% accuracy?
3. can the sampling optimized for observable A also good for observable B, or is there an optimal strategy to make this more universal?
